text = "Dear Amazon, last week I ordered an Optimus Prime action figure from your online store in Germany. Unfortunately, when I opened the package, I discovered to my horror that I had been sent an action figure of Megatron instead! As a lifelong enemy of the Decepticons, I hope you can understand my dilemma. To resolve the issue, I demand an exchange of Megatron for the Optimus Prime figure I ordered. Enclosed are copies of my records concerning this purchase. I expect to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Bumblebee."
